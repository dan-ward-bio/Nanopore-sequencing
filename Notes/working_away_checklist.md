# Checks before working with a collaborator in another country.

### Equipment and reagents
#### **Lab**
* Flow cell checks on delivery. Especially in regions with logistics issues.
* Always buy more priming kits.
* Sufficient magnets for 96-well / 1.5 mL workflows.
* Positive controls for all assays.

#### **Compute**
* Make sure there is sufficient storage and redundant storage for the data. * Estimate the yield, number of samples.
* Stable internet connection. Test uplink to server.

### Project specifics
* Issue protocols to everyone prior to starting.
* Give a presentation, talking through all protocol before arrival. Test understanding.
* Clearly define the outcomes: what are the deliverables? Do you have informatics capacity? Are you willing to learn? Or is it just data generation? If it is teaching, define risk.
* How many people want to learn and in what amount of time?

### Sample checks
* Check samples on a gel or a bio-analyser for DNA integrity/fragmentation.
* Plate all DNA samples in to 96-well format before arrival.
* All QC, quantification and metadata cleaning should be done before arrival. Eyeball dataframe and check integrity.


### Amplicon sequencing specific
* At least two 8 channel 10 ÂµL pipettes for amplicon sequencing.
* Capacity to run gels **quickly**. Suggest combs compatible with multi-channels.
* Test primers/PCR protocol beforehand, eyeball gel for primer degredation.
* PCR separation. Cabinet UV, hypochlorite.
