# Some notes on how to prepare for a nanopore sequencing project.

### Below are some things you should consider before embarking on a nanopore sequencing  project. I've been lucky enough to have been involved in nanopore sequencing for a few years. I've applied it in high/low resource settings, low/high throughput contexts, with WGS, WGA, SWGA, amplicon inputs. The guide will cover:

1. Reagents and equipment: both from ONT and elsewhere.
2. Sample requirements: Concentrations, volumes, QC and enrichment.
3. Informatics requirements: Compute, software and troubleshooting.
4. Tips and tricks.
5. Adaptive sampling.

## 1. Reagents and equipment and their costs

Tables to calculate the volumes required for each enzyme
List of enzymes and equipment
How many times can you use a flow cell? What yield can be expected?
Scalability - yield calculation.


## 2. Input samples

Run gels or bioanalyser - can also do the test. Fragmentation.
Extraction techniques
Volumes and concentration


## 3. Informatics requirements

Laptop, storage
GPU with RAM
Linux or windows?
CUDA
Downstream applications and QC - Kraken etc

## 4. Tips

Put a dash each time a barcode is used in the NBD***-24 kit, and the same with the reagents.

The library N50 test

Multiple libraries in one prep. Stable for a long time.
